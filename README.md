 FEATURES
 
 v1.0
 This program allows a user to enter a grade for multiple students within a single course, and displays class grade statistics.
 
 This program prompts the user to input their classes title. It then asks the user to enter the grades for the class,
 one at a time until all the grades have been entered, or a sentinel value of -1 or less is entered to exit the grade entry prompts.
 The program then displays the following statistics to the user:
 the class title, the number of grades entered, the maximum, minimum, average, and the sum of the grades entered.
